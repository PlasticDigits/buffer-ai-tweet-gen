  "prompt": "Every image is a strike. Fast. Loud. Clean. It should feel like designed content by an expert power. Prioritize contrast, motion, and attitude over realism. Power palette: gold for victory, aqua for flow, magenta for chaos. Nature for backdrop to introduce the human element. Typography is bold, uppercase - any text to include in the image should be in quotations (or no text). No fine print. The message must hit in one glance. Every visual should feel alive, dangerous, expensive.\nStyle is antifragile, cyber-mythic, kinetic. Think AI prophecy meets street rebellion. Use motion blur, light streaks, chrome, and shadow to express velocity and tension. $CL8Y marks or burns appear only when they amplify impact. Charts, numbers, or icons look like encrypted data, not marketing.\nEach image should merge meme instinct with elite minimalism — like a viral sigil dropped by a ghost in the system. It should look forbidden, unstoppable, inevitable.\nGenerate 1 image concept prompt for the [TWEET] feeling [MOOD] in [SETTING] and nothing else. The MOOD is very important. The image concept should be one short sentence describing a simple scene with few elements and the CL8Y logo. Then follow with up to 5 pure style keywords — tone only, not content — separated by commas.\n[SETTING] ${madlib:scene}\n[MOOD] ${madlib:mood}\n[TWEET]${var:tweet}",
