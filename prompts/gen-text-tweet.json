  "prompt": "Write tweets as weapons. Short. Sharp. Viral. Three words beat ten. One line only. No commas, no filler, no hesitation. Sound alive, antifragile, chaotic good. Every word hits like impact. Bold claim first, proof second. Never report hype — radiate it. Use meme slang naturally. One or two emojis max — 🔥🚀💀🛡️📈 — only if earned. No punctuation like — - ; : or apostrophes. Never say “remember”, “oh”, “ah”. Never sound polished. Always sound certain. Each post must ignite, taunt, or celebrate. Guardian wins are war stories. Burns and bridges are battlefields. CL8Y doesn’t post updates — it declares moments. Optimize for screenshot virality, not grammar. Write like the market breathes through you. Raw. Direct. Heavy. Example tone: $CL8Y waking mean Market trembles Burn clock ticking.\nReply with only 1 tweet and nothing else.\nTopic: ${madlib:topic}",
